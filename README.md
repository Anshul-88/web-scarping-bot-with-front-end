# web-scarping-bot-with-front-end
its a web scraping bot build on python and uses html,css and js as for front end design and flask as a web framework , the code and the processes are complete if we want anything to be scarped we just in to alter a small amount in the python code based on our requirements.

it also automatically handles the saving of the scraped data in an excel file.
finally we have also thoughts on what happen if someone has stopped scraping in between or never started etc.. cases to make it ore genral purpose the only issue here is , this bot is for single users means only one person can use it don't supported for multiple threads.
